\chapter{Neutrino Physics}

Overview of neutrino physics:

- Current main research challenges: neutrinos interacting with nuclei, this needing description of neutrino nucleon interactions, plus generalization to the interaction with the nucleus as a whole. Not producing complete kinematics. Variety of models needed to address different energy levels and areas of phase space.

- Role and goals of current and planned experiments. Neutrino oscillations, matter dominance, proton decay

Neutrino physics and computation

- Role of MC generators in the research

- Overview of how they work/what they do, emphasis on GENIE

- Quick overview of some of the inputs (tunes, models etc)

- Mentioning some challenges? -->> probably covered by the research challenge section. Consider reordering
