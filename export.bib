Using a range of different schemes, logical qubits that are resistant to errors can be redundantly encoded in a set of error-prone physical qubits. One such scalable approach is based on the surface code. Here we experimentally implement its smallest viable instance, capable of repeatedly detecting any single error using seven superconducting qubits—four data qubits and three ancilla qubits. Using high-fidelity ancilla-based stabilizer measurements, we initialize the cardinal states of the encoded logical qubit with an average logical fidelity of 96.1%. We then repeatedly check for errors using the stabilizer readout and observe that the logical quantum state is preserved with a lifetime and a coherence time longer than those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected. Our demonstration of error detection with its resulting enhancement of the conditioned logical qubit coherence times is an important step, indicating a promising route towards the realization of quantum error correction in the surface code.},

The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},

   abstract = {The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to outperform classical ones in useful tasks. One method to achieve this is quantum error correction (QEC), which prevents noise in the underlying system from causing logical errors.&nbsp;This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local, that is, it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, we can—for a limited time—detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information1. In 2001, Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) proposed a hardware-efficient instance of such a non-local qubit: a superposition of position eigenstates&nbsp;that forms grid states of a single oscillator2. However, the implementation of measurements that reveal this noise-induced evolution of the oscillator while preserving the encoded information3–7 has proved to be experimentally challenging, and the only realization reported so far relied on post-selection8,9, which is incompatible with QEC. Here we experimentally prepare square and hexagonal GKP code states through a feedback protocol that incorporates non-destructive measurements that are implemented with a superconducting microwave cavity having the role of the oscillator. We demonstrate QEC of an encoded qubit with suppression of all logical errors, in quantitative agreement with a theoretical estimate based on the measured imperfections of the experiment. Our protocol is applicable to other continuous-variable systems and, in contrast to previous implementations of QEC10–14, can mitigate all logical errors generated by a wide variety of noise processes and facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correction of Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill code states is realized experimentally in a superconducting quantum device.},

For fault-tolerant operation quantum computers must correct errors occurring due to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy.

Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit building up on recent distance-two error detection experiments. In an error correction cycle taking only $1.1\,\mu$s, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit- and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in postprocessing. We find a low error probability of $3\,\%$ per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps, support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable.},

By storing a qubit in the parity of two or four qumodes, all computing processes can be implemented by basis state preparations, continuous-variable exponential-swap operations, and swap tests. Our formalism inherits the advantages that the quantum information is decoupled from collective noise, and logical qubits with different encodings can be brought to interact without decoding. We also propose a possible implementation of the required operations by using interactions that are available in a variety of continuous-variable systems. Our work separates the "hardware" problem of engineering quantum-computing-universal interactions, from the "software" problem of designing encodings for specific purposes.

Logical operations are challenging, owing to the necessary non-local operations at the physical level, making bosonic logical qubits that rely on higher Fock states of a single oscillator attractive, given their hardware efficiency. QEC that reaches the break-even point and single logical-qubit operations have been demonstrated using the bosonic cat code. Here, we experimentally demonstrate repetitive QEC approaching the break-even point of a single logical qubit encoded in a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting circuit and a bosonic cavity using a binomial bosonic code. This is achieved while simultaneously maintaining full control of the single logical qubit, including encoding, decoding and a high-fidelity universal quantum gate set with 97% average process fidelity.

The binomial codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the time step between error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes, but offer the advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to "cat codes" based on superpositions of the coherent states but offer several advantages such as smaller mean boson number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are realizable with current superconducting circuit technology, and they should prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and down-conversion.},

Beyond that, universal gate sets and fault-tolerant operations on the bosonic codes are also realized, pushing quantum information processing towards the QEC era. In this article, we review the recent progress of the bosonic codes, including the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes, cat codes, and binomial codes, and discuss the opportunities of bosonic codes in various quantum applications, ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computation to quantum metrology.

Many applications call for error rates as low as 10−15 (refs. 2–9), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10−3 (refs. 10–14). Quantum error correction15–17 promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection&nbsp;with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code&nbsp;on the same device18,19 and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.

It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

   abstract = {Encoding quantum information into a set of harmonic oscillators is considered a hardware efficient approach to mitigate noise for reliable quantum information processing. Various codes have been proposed to encode a qubit into an oscillator -- including cat codes, binomial codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes -- and are among the first to reach a break-even point for quantum error correction. Though GKP codes are widely recognized for their promise in quantum computation, they also facilitate near-optimal quantum communication rates in bosonic channels and offer the ability to safeguard arbitrary quantum states of oscillators. This review focuses on the basic working mechanism, performance characterization, and the many applications of GKP codes -- emphasizing recent experimental progress in superconducting circuit architectures and theoretical advancements in multimode GKP qubit codes and oscillators-to-oscillators (O2O) codes. We begin with a preliminary continuous-variable formalism needed for bosonic codes. We then proceed to the quantum engineering involved to physically realize GKP states. We take a deep dive into GKP stabilization and preparation in superconducting architectures and examine proposals for realizing GKP states in the optical domain (along with a concise review of GKP realization in trapped-ion platforms). Finally, we present multimode GKP qubits and GKP-O2O codes, examine code performance and discuss applications of GKP codes in quantum information processing tasks such as computing, communication, and sensing.},

   abstract = {The precise measurement of neutrino properties is among the highest priorities in fundamental particle physics, involving many experiments worldwide. Since the experiments rely on the interactions of neutrinos with bound nucleons inside atomic nuclei, the planned advances in the scope and precision of these experiments requires a commensurate effort in the understanding and modeling of the hadronic and nuclear physics of these interactions, which is incorporated as a nuclear model in neutrino event generators. This model is essential to every phase of experimental analyses and its theoretical uncertainties play an important role in interpreting every result. In this White Paper we discuss in detail the impact of neutrino-nucleus interactions, especially the nuclear effects, on the measurement of neutrino properties using the determination of oscillation parameters as a central example. After an Executive Summary and a concise Overview of the issues, we explain how the neutrino event generators work, what can be learned from electron-nucleus interactions and how each underlying physics process - from quasi-elastic to deep inelastic scattering - is understood today. We then emphasize how our understanding must improve to meet the demands of future experiments. With every topic we find that the challenges can be met only with the active support and collaboration among specialists in strong interactions and electroweak physics that include theorists and experimentalists from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.},

PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx In this article we describe the surface code approach to quantum computing. We have attempted to maximize clarity and simplicity, while perhaps sacrificing some rigor. The article is targeted at an audience with a good grounding in basic quantum mechanics, but assumes no additional knowledge regarding surface codes, error correction, or topological information processing. We do however assume some prior knowledge of the ba-sics of qubits and quantum computing, including familiarity with single qubit operations such asˆXasˆ asˆX bit-flips andˆZandˆ andˆZ phase-flips, the Hadamard gate, and the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate as well as the multi-qubit Toffoli gate. We also assume a working understanding of quantum circuits and their terminology. We refer the uninitiated reader to one of the excellent texts on this topic, e.g. Ref. [1] or [2]. I. BACKGROUND Quantum computers provide a means to solve certain problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable period of time using a conventional, classical computer. These problems include factoring very large numbers into their primes, which on a quantum computer can be accomplished relatively quickly using Shor's algorithm [3], and searching large, unstructured data sets, which can be done on a quantum computer using Grover's search algorithm [4, 5]. A number of physical systems are being explored for their use in quantum computing, including ions, spins in semiconductors, and superconducting circuits [6, 7]. However, none of these systems perform sufficiently well to serve directly as computational qubits. It is however possible to construct a logical qubit from a collection of physical qubits, such that the logical qubit performs much better than the individual physical qubits. One approach to building a quantum computer is based on surface codes [8, 9], operated as stabilizer codes [10]. The surface codes evolved from an invention of Alexei Kitaev known as toric codes [11-14], which arose from his efforts to develop simple models for topological order, using qubits distributed on the surface of a toroid. The toroidal geometry employed by Kitaev turned out to be unnecessary, and planar versions (thus "surface codes") were developed by Bravyi and Kitaev as well as Freedman and Meyer [8, 15]. One of the significant advantages of surface codes is their relative tolerance to local errors, as was first described by Preskill and co-workers [16]. In this publication , the critical logical CNOT operation was implemented using stacked layers of surfaces, a three-dimensional structure that significantly complicates potential physical implementations, but the ability of the surface codes to withstand large error rates was apparent: These authors showed that the surface codes could handle error rates of almost 3% per surface code clock cycle, assuming the ability to measure a four-qubit operator. Raussendorf and co-workers then discovered that the logical CNOT operation could be implemented by braid transformations on a single surface, a highly significant simplification [17-19]. These authors also evaluated error tolerances for a fully planar implementation using only one-and two-qubit nearest-neighbor gates, arriving at an},

Here we experimentally implement its smallest viable instance, capable of repeatedly detecting any single error using seven superconducting qubits, four data qubits and three ancilla qubits. Using high-fidelity ancilla-based stabilizer measurements we initialize the cardinal states of the encoded logical qubit with an average logical fidelity of 96.1%. We then repeatedly check for errors using the stabilizer readout and observe that the logical quantum state is preserved with a lifetime and coherence time longer than those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected. Our demonstration of error detection with its resulting enhancement of the conditioned logical qubit coherence times in a 7-qubit surface code is an important step indicating a promising route towards the realization of quantum error correction in the surface code.},

Given the importance of magic for quantum computation, it would be useful to have a method for measuring the amount of magic in a quantum state. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring magic based on randomized measurements. Our experiments are carried out on two IBM Quantum Falcon processors.

   abstract = {Quantum theory promises computation speed-ups than classical means. The full power is believed to reside in "magic" states, or equivalently non-Clifford operations -- the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computing. Despite the celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem stating that magic-free computation can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer, it is still questionable whether "magic" is really magical. Indeed, all the existing results establish its supremacy for efficient computation upon unproven complexity assumptions or queries to black-box oracles. In this work, we show that the magic advantage can be unconditionally established, at least in a shallow circuit with a constant depth. For this purpose, we first construct a specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system, which requires the magic resource to generate the desired nonlocal statistics or quantum "pseudo telepathy." For a relation problem targeting generating such correlations between arbitrary nonlocal computation sites, we construct a shallow circuit with bounded fan-in gates that takes the strategy for quantum pseudo telepathy as a sub-routine to solve the problem with certainty. In contrast, magic-free counterparts inevitably require a logarithmic circuit depth to the input size, and the separation is proven optimal. As by-products, we prove that the nonlocal game we construct has non-unique perfect winning strategies, answering an open problem in quantum self-testing. We also provide an efficient algorithm to aid the search for potential magic-requiring nonlocal games similar to the current one. We anticipate our results to enlighten the ultimate establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum computation.},

   abstract = {We compute the medium-mass nuclei $^\{16\}$O and $^\{40\}$Ca using pionless effective field theory (EFT) at next-to-leading order (NLO). The low-energy coefficients of the EFT Hamiltonian are adjusted to experimantal data for nuclei with mass numbers $A=2$ and $3$, or alternatively to results from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at an unphysical pion mass of 806 MeV. The EFT is implemented through a discrete variable representation in the harmonic oscillator basis. This approach ensures rapid convergence with respect to the size of the model space and facilitates the computation of medium-mass nuclei. At NLO the nuclei $^\{16\}$O and $^\{40\}$Ca are bound with respect to decay into alpha particles. Binding energies per nucleon are 9-10 MeV and 30-40 MeV at pion masses of 140 MeV and 806 MeV, respectively.},

   abstract = {Simulating the full dynamics of a quantum field theory over a wide range of energies requires exceptionally large quantum computing resources. Yet for many observables in particle physics, perturbative techniques are sufficient to accurately model all but a constrained range of energies within the validity of the theory. We demonstrate that effective field theories (EFTs) provide an efficient mechanism to separate the high energy dynamics that is easily calculated by traditional perturbation theory from the dynamics at low energy and show how quantum algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of the low energy EFT from first principles. As an explicit example we calculate the expectation values of vacuum-to-vacuum and vacuum-to-one-particle transitions in the presence of a time-ordered product of two Wilson lines in scalar field theory, an object closely related to those arising in EFTs of the standard model of particle physics. Calculations are performed using simulations of a quantum computer as well as measurements using the IBMQ Manhattan machine. It is well known that quantum computers can in principle simulate the time evolution of quantum field theories [1]. The main technique involves disretizing the spatial degrees of freedom by introducing a lattice [2-4], and digitizing the field values at a given lattice point [5-13]. This turns the uncountably infinite dimensional Hilbert space of standard quantum field theories into a finite dimensional Hilbert space of dimension n H ¼ n ðN d Þ ϕ ; ð1Þ where n ϕ denotes the dimensionality of the Hilbert space for a given lattice point, N is the total number of lattice points in each spatial direction, and d represents the number of spatial dimensions. The physical volume of the lattice is determined by the distance between adjacent lattice points δx in each direction and is given by V ¼ ðNδxÞ d ≡ L d : ð2Þ The total number of qubits required for such a simulation is given by n Q ¼ Oðlog 2 n H Þ ¼ OðN d log 2 n ϕ Þ: ð3Þ The discretization and finite volume of space introduce upper and lower cutoffs to the energies E over which the resulting lattice field theory is a good approximation for the continuum. In particular, one finds 1 Nδx ≲ E ≲ 1 δx ; ð4Þ which implies that the range of energies that can be described is directly proportional to the number of lattice sites per dimension. In principle, to have access to the full dynamics of the Large Hadron Collinder (LHC), one would need to describe the energy range between Oð10 MeVÞ (the smallest resolvable transverse momentum between hadrons) and 7 TeV (the beam energy of the LHC). To fully capture this energy range would require a lattice with Oð10 6 Þ lattice points in each dimension, and more than 10 18 qubits to reproduce the resulting physical system. Even if one does not require the full energy range up to the LHC center-of-mass energy, the number of qubits required for a full simulation will clearly remain beyond the realm of feasibility for a long time to come. For many observables of interest at the LHC, physics at short distances is reliably computed in fixed order perturbation theory, and high precision can be reached with existing techniques. Physics at lower energies introduces new significant challenges. Asymptotic freedom [14,15]},

   abstract = {Neutrino-nucleus cross section uncertainties are expected to be a dominant systematic in future accelerator neutrino experiments. The cross sections are determined by the linear response of the nucleus to the weak interactions of the neutrino, and are dominated by energy and distance scales of the order of the separation between nucleons in the nucleus. These response functions are potentially an important early physics application of quantum computers. Here we present an analysis of the resources required and their expected scaling for scattering cross section calculations. We also examine simple small-scale neutrino-nucleus models on modern quantum hardware. In this paper, we use variational methods to obtain the ground state of a three nucleon system (the triton) and then implement the relevant time evolution. In order to tame the errors in present-day NISQ devices, we explore the use of different error-mitigation techniques to increase the fidelity of the calculations.},

   abstract = {Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. In particular, within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. We consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. We examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. Our results show that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate and the dynamical-pion theory is the costliest. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds on the simulation algorithm. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. We further develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic Hamiltonians that preserve the number of fermions, and demonstrate that reasonably tight Trotter error bounds can be achieved by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. This work highlights the importance of combining physics insights and algorithmic advancement in reducing quantum-simulation costs.},

Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.},
