\chapter*{Abstract}

This report aims to summarize the work carried out in the first academic year of this PhD project. The main goal of the project is to contribute to High Energy Physics by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computing. To this end, the focus of the work so far has been placed on Quantum Error Correction. This discipline is essential to the development of useful results using quantum systems. An overview of the topic and relevant literature is given in this report, alongside some implementations. Furthermore, some background is provided on the status of neutrino physics, in particular regarding simulations and event generators, essential to understanding the data produced by experiments. To conclude, the possible next steps for the project are outlined.
